# magma-nms-nginx-proxy

## Description

Magmaâ€™s NMS provides a single pane of glass for managing Magma based networks. NMS provides the
ability to configure gateways and associated eNodeBs, provides visibility into status, events and
metrics observed in these networks and finally ability to configure and receive alerts.
<br>
Visit [Magma NMS Overview](https://docs.magmacore.org/docs/nms/nms_arch_overview) to learn more.

This [Juju](https://juju.is/) Charm deploys an **nginx** web server that proxies communication
between NMS UI and MagmaLTE.<br>

## Usage

**magma-nms-nginx-proxy** can be deployed via Juju command line using below commands:

```bash
juju deploy magma-nms-nginx-proxy nms-nginx-proxy
```

**IMPORTANT**: For now, deploying this charm must be done with an alias as shown above.

To work correctly, **magma-nms-nginx-proxy** requires **magma-orc8r-certifier** and 
**magma-nms-magmalte** (for details, check the _Relations_ section below).

To deploy **magma-orc8r-certifier** from Juju command line:

```bash
juju deploy magma-orc8r-certifier --config domain=example.com orc8r-certifier
juju relate nms-nginx-proxy orc8r-certifier
```

To deploy **magma-nms-magmalte** from Juju command line:

```bash
juju deploy magma-nms-magmalte nms-magmalte
juju relate nms-nginx-proxy nms-magmalte
```

## Load Balancer

For NMS to be accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster, you must enable the `metallb` loadbalancer
in your microk8s cluster.
```bash
microk8s enable metallb
```

You will be asked to provide a range of IP's that can be used by metallb.


## Relations

Currently supported relations are:

- [magma-nms-magmalte](https://github.com/canonical/charmed-magma/tree/main/orchestrator-bundle/nms-magmalte-operator) - Magmalte is
  a microservice built using express framework. It contains set of application and router level
  middlewares. It uses sequelize ORM to connect to the NMS DB for servicing any routes involving DB
  interaction.
- [magma-orc8r-certifier](https://github.com/canonical/charmed-magma/tree/main/orchestrator-bundle/orc8r-certifier-operator) -
  magma-orc8r-certifier maintains and verifies signed client certificates and their associated
  identities.
- [nginx-ingress-ingegrator](https://charmhub.io/nginx-ingress-integrator) - Nginx Ingress Integrator
  generates an Nginx Ingress resource for sidecar charms using the Operator Framework. This 
  resource can then be used by an Nginx Ingress Controller in a Kubernetes cluster to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to a charm running within the cluster.
