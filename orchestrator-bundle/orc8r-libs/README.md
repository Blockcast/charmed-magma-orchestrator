# magma-orc8r-libs

## Description

magma-orc8r-libs is a placeholder charm that contains libraries used for magma orc8r.

## Usage
While it is possible to deploy this charm, it is essentially a no-op, and not what this charm was 
designed for.

Where this charm should be used, is to access one of the following libraries during development:
- Orc8rBase - a small library used as a base charm for all of orc8r charms. Most orc8r charms
are very similar and this library makes it possible to avoid code duplication between the charms.
